### Local Setup

From the command line:

1. Navigate to the root `/tapchat` directory, then run `npm install`. NPM will look at [package.json](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/package.json) and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

**Unfamiliar with npm or if you don't have node installed?** That's okay! NPM stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.

**Run Debug Server**

1. Run `npm start`
2. Visit [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) on your browser to see the app running.


### Troubleshooting dependencies

Should you encounter problems while installing dependencies, uninstall all previous dependency versions (global and local). Then, the command `npm install` again.
